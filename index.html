        <p>What do we know about space?</p>
        <p>
          Looking at the stars on the sky at night and following the movement of
          the sun at the day time, experiencing solar and moon eclipses,
          northern lights and meteoric showers, people from ancient times have
          begun to think about space. It conceals many secrets and mysteries,
          and, even nowadays, at the period of high developed technological
          progress, the scientists are still puzzled with a great number of
          unresolved questions. Studying cosmos we hope to find another
          civilizations or at least simple forms of life.

          Some people believe that the humanity was brought to the Earth through
          space. According to this theory, powerful and mighty aliens created
          people as slaves to extract gold. It is supposed that those aliens
          have built pyramids and other magnificent buildings.

          But still we donâ€™t know even a millionth part of space. What sizes
          does Universe have? Who has created this world? What will happen to
          our planet in the future?
