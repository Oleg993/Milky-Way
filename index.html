        <p>What do we know about space?</p>
        <p>
          Looking at the stars on the sky at night and following the movement of
          the sun at the day time, experiencing solar and moon eclipses,
          northern lights and meteoric showers, people from ancient times have
          begun to think about space. It conceals many secrets and mysteries,
          and, even nowadays, at the period of high developed technological
          progress, the scientists are still puzzled with a great number of
          unresolved questions. Studying cosmos we hope to find another
          civilizations or at least simple forms of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people believe that the humanity was brought to the Earth through
          space. According to this theory, powerful and mighty aliens created
          people as slaves to extract gold. It is supposed that those aliens
          have built pyramids and other magnificent buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still we don’t know even a millionth part of space. What sizes
          does Universe have? Who has created this world? What will happen to
          our planet in the future?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Solar System is the most fully discovered part of the Universe.
          Several times, the scientists have sent a shuttle to study nearby
          planets. So let’s sum up what do we know about the Solar System. Our
          sun is represented by a young star, with nine planets spinning around
          it.

        <p>Space exploration</p>
        <p>
          The scientific exploration of space began in 350 BC, when Aristotle
          began to share his thoughts and theories about vacuum and shapes of
          the planets. With Galileo’s invention of a telescope, it has become
          possible to observe space bodies, first of inner and later of outer
          space. In the 20th century people built space ships, sputniks and
          space stations. Human has visited moon and is going to build a
          settlement on Mars.
        </p>

          The people always dreamed about space travelling and flying to
          different stars. In the 20th century this dream came true. The first
          satellite «Sputnik-1» was launched on the 4th of October 1957. It was
          the unmanned spacecraft. The first leaving creature entered the space
          on the 3th of November 1957. It was the dog Laika on board of
          «Sputnik-2». The turtle from Kazakhstan was carried around the Luna on
          the 21st of September 1968.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Russian spacecraft «Vostok-1» started with Juri Gagarin on board
          from the cosmodrome Baikonur on the 12th of April 1961. This spaceship
          carried the first Russian cosmonaut around the Earth. Gagarin was the
          first human in the history of mankind who had a possibility to look at
          our planet from space and to experience the weightless environment. He
          stayed on the low earth orbit for 108 minutes.

<!-- 
<p>
  Planets of our solar system can be divided into groups according to
  the proximity to the Sun. The first group includes four planets:
  Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. They are called terrestrial planets.
  These planets consist of metal and rocks.
</p>
<p>
  Mercury is the smallest and the nearest to the Sun planet. Venus can
  be easily seen at night. It is the second largest object after the
  moon on the night sky. Mars is also known as a red planet. It is cold
  and has volcanic surface.
</p>
<p>
  The second group is called giant planets. Two of them — Jupiter and
  Saturn consist of gases and the others — Uranus and Neptune are large
  icy spheres.
</p>
<p>
  All the planets have their own orbit and period of spinning around the
  Sun. The time goes differently on each of them. Some of them have
  natural satellites. The Earth has the only one such satellite – the
  Moon.
</p>
<p>
  The Moon is always turned to us by only one side. The dark side of the
  Moon is supposed to have a lot of secrets. Nobody has ever seen it; we
  have just photos from sputniks. The Moon has particular impact on our
  planet. The tides of seas and oceans depend on the Moons position. All
  the living creatures feel the Moon’s influence.
</p>
<p>
  Even considering themselves developed beings; people are a part of the
  Universe and the entire natural phenomenon interfere with their lives.
